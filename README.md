# Tokenloss (*Science Fiction*)

## What is Tokenloss?

1. ### **This is a science fiction novel** 

   1. This is not programming code, datasets, or technical documentation.
   2. It is a science fiction novel that can be collaborated through Github.

2. ### **Features**

   1. #### Main concept and worldview
      
      1. ##### The world is largely divided into two categories: the real world and the virtual reality. The largest and most widely used virtual reality is called Overworld.
      2. ##### The conflict between humans with and without Ethereum super tokens (cryptopunk, etc.) intensifies.
         
         1. Ethereum token holders unite to establish a new country with super powers that surpass the United States and China. This is called United Contracts.
         2. Human status is classified according to the tokens you have. (AI status is also classified.)
      3. ##### Humans and AI coexist. However, as the AI gets stronger, the confrontation between the two intensifies.
         
         1. There are AIs that are hostile to humans.
      4.  ##### United Contract uses the Ethereum blockchain for all voting.
         
         1. ###### There is a bug that can manipulate Ethereum governance. (There is a bug that can disable the decentralization of Ethereum.)
            
            1. The bug was intentionally inserted by early developers of Ethereum, who predicted that AI's voting power would be stronger, to secure human dominance over Ethereum.
            2. Tokens capable of executing bugs may only be used by the Secretary-General of United Contract.
               1. The secretary-general is died in an accident and the tokens become unavailable.
                  1. The secretary-general created a personal virtual reality and hid it there in case Seedword was lost.
                  2. The protagonists enter virtual reality to find Seedword.
   2. #### Detail settings and worldview
      
      1. ##### Settings for NFT writer's creative topics
         
         1. ###### AI has three appearaces. (You can draw several pictures on one character.)
            
            1. Basic appearance in virtual reality.
               1. It usually looks like a cute monster.
            2. Appearance in a human form in virtual reality.
               1. It is illegal for AI to take on human form in public places. (There is hierarchy between human and AI.)
            3. Appearance of a robot to enter the real world
               1. This is because AI created in virtual reality does not have a physical body.

3. ### **Goal of the tokenloss project**

   1. #### Create a new science fiction worldview after Star Wars.

      1. ##### Recently, the gap between reality and science fiction is rapidly narrowing. The world is changing very rapidly.
         
         1. ###### The sci-fi worldviews created before are very different from the present future we predict now. So it's not fun. We need a new worldview.

   2. #### It provides the endless stories that NFT writers and collectors need.

      1. ##### NFT collectors are reluctant to buy work that doesn't have a story. Because it can be difficult to resell.

      2. ##### NFT author(not a writer) could feel difficulty when they are making a new stroy
   It's also a problem to continue to build a community for the new story.
