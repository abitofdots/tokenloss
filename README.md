# Tokenloss (*Science Fiction with NFT Artworks*)

## What is Tokenloss?

1. ### **This is a science fiction novel** 

   1. This is not programming code, datasets, or technical documentation.
   2. It is a science fiction novel that can be collaborated through Github.

2. ### Why use Github?

   1. To create a story that lasts and develops forever. We call this type of story a legend.

3. ### Story Features

   1. #### Main concept and worldview

      1. The world is largely divided into two categories: the real world and the virtual reality. The largest and most widely used virtual reality is called Overworld.

         - The real world aims to be the same as the world we live in. (USA and China exist and use Ethereum blockchain, etc.)

      2. The conflict between humans with and without Ethereum super tokens (cryptopunk, etc.) intensifies.

         - Ethereum token holders unite to establish a new country with super powers that surpass the United States and China. This is called United Contracts.

      3. Humans and AI coexist. However, as the AI gets stronger, the confrontation between the two intensifies.

         - There are AIs that are hostile to humans.

      4. United Contract uses the Ethereum blockchain for all voting.

         - There is a bug that can manipulate Ethereum governance. (There is a bug that can disable the decentralization of Ethereum.) The bug was intentionally inserted by early developers of Ethereum, who predicted that AI's voting power would be stronger, to secure human dominance over Ethereum.
        1. Tokens capable of executing bugs may only be used by the Secretary-General of United Contract. And the secretary-general is died in an accident and the tokens become unavailable. The secretary-general created a personal virtual reality and hid it there in case Seedword was lost. The protagonists enter virtual reality to find Seedword.
   2. #### Detail settings and worldview

      1. ##### Settings for NFT author's creative topics

         - AI has three appearances. (You can draw several pictures on one character.)
           1. Basic appearance in virtual reality.
              1. It usually looks like a cute monster. It is illegal for AI to take on human form in public places. There is hierarchy between human and AI.
           2. Appearance in a human form in virtual reality. 
           3. Appearance of a robot to enter the real world. This is because AI created in virtual reality does not have a physical body.

4. ### **Goal of the tokenloss project**

   1. #### Create a new science fiction with the most massive worldview after Star Wars.

      - Recently, the gap between reality and science fiction is rapidly narrowing. The world is getting closer to science fiction. The sci-fi worldviews created before are very different from the future we predict now. 
        1. So it's not fun. We need a new worldview.

   2. #### Prevent the work from being forgotten through a story that continues and develops.

      - *NFT collectors* are reluctant to buy work that doesn't have a story. This is because the work is apt to be forgotten and difficult to resell.
      - *NFT authors* could feel difficulty when they are making a new story. It's also a problem to continue to build a community for the new story.
      - It's also difficult for *science fiction writers* to make revenue just by writing.
      - **<u>Tokenloss offers a huge theme that solves the problems of the three workers above.</u>**
